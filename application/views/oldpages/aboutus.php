	  <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>   KONNIPATIS® is the world's largest business networking, referrals and word of mouth marketing organization.   </b></p>   <p class="w3-myfont">Our Philosophy</p>   <p class="w3-myfont1">The philosophy of this organization is built upon the idea of "Givers Gain®": By giving business to others, you will get business in return. This is predicated on the age-old idea of "What goes around, comes around."</p>       <p class="w3-myfont"> Our Mission</p>   <p class="w3-myfont1">The mission of KONNIPATIS is to help members increase their business through a structured, positive, and professional "word-of-mouth" program that enables them to develop long-term, meaningful relationships with quality business professionals.</p>    <p class="w3-myfont"> Belonging to KONNIPATIS is like having dozens of sales people working for you...</p>   <p class="w3-myfont1">...because all of them carry several copies of your business cards around with them. When they meet someone who could use your products or services, they take out your card and recommend you.* It's as simple as that! It's simple because it's based on a proven concept by KONNIPATIS Founder, Dr. Konnipati Sreenath, called "Givers Gain®." If I give you business you'll give me business and we'll both benefit as a result.</p>     <p class="w3-myfont"> Last year alone, members of KONNIPATIS passed 6.6 million referrals...</p>   <p class="w3-myfont1">...which generated over $8.6 billion dollars' (U.S.) worth of business for its members! KONNIPATIS is a business and professional networking organization that allows only one person per professional classification or specialty to join a chapter.</p>      <p class="w3-myfont"> Would you like to increase your business by 20%, 30%, 50% or as much as 100%</p>   <p class="w3-myfont1">You can see results like this! Many have. Some participants have added as many as 50 new clients in the first 2 years!!! Successful businesses depend on word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth advertising is the best advertising there is.</p>      <p class="w3-myfont"> KONNIPATIS provides a structured and supportive system of giving and receiving business</p>   <p class="w3-myfont1">It does so by providing an environment in which you develop personal relationships with dozens of other qualified business professionals. By establishing this "formal" relationship with other people, you will have the opportunity to substantially increase your business.</p>      <i class="w3-myfont1 w3-tangerine">(*) Note, some professions, specifically attorneys and certain health care professionals, may not be permitted to seek direct referrals through in-person solicitation through the use of business cards pursuant to their ethical code. Members of KONNIPATIS that belong to these professions are directed to follow their profession's own ethical guidelines.</i>         	</div>	    </div><div class="w3-center w3-padding">
